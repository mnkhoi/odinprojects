        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. 
            I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounces) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped carrot</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped brocolli</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, carrot, broccoli, peas, and green onion in melted butter until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Scramble egg in the skillet until completely set. Return the pork mixture to the skillet. Stir rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the pork mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
